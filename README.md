# angular-sharejs-example

This project is a sample application that integrates [Sharejs](http://sharejs.org/) with
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).


## Dependencies
It uses the following:

* ShareJS
* livedb
* MongoDB
* Browserchannel

Naturally, the package.json file will install the appropriate dependencies, but you'll also need access to a MongoDB
database server.

## Getting started

 1. Clone the application
 2. npm install
 3. bower install
 4. Point to the correct MongoDb database

## Run the Application

You can use gulp to run the application by running the default task, or you can use node directly

```
node server.js
```

The default port is 3000, so the application should be available at  `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

This is just a sample application so there are no automatic tests for this.  Sorry about that.

## Known problems

None
